1. I updated the gulpfile.js lib task to copy over dependencies listed from index.html.
Based on the file from spboyer's ng-startingline it looked out of date compared to the new
quickstart from the angular repo




Installing:
-At root run 'gulp'
-cd into build
-npm install any server dependencies
-node index.js

--Moving over 404 from systemjs.config.js to gulpfile.js in the lib task
